## Install Notes
1. Enable Cloud Vision API, Maps JavaScript API and Google Cloud Storage JSON API
1. Open the Credentials menu and create a Service account key (choose JSON as key type) and download the file to your computer. Also in the Credentials menu create an API key for Google Maps. Select HTTP referrers (web sites) under Application restrictions and enter the URLs that are allowed to show the map. In my case I added http://localhost:8100/* for development and https://demo.rasc.ch/* for production.
1. Set API key in app.module.ts
```
    AgmCoreModule.forRoot({
      apiKey: 'yourkey'
    }),
```
1. npm install @agm/core
1. `npm rebuild node-sass`
1. `npm install --save rxjs-compat`
1. `node_modules/.bin/ng s --port 4201`
1. Install Google Cloud SDK - https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/
1. Configure CORS on storage bucket - https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/configuring-cors

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Mathou54/petStore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Mathou54/petStore)

Prototype of a pet store application in Angular and Java.

[https://m-petstore.herokuapp.com/pet](https://m-petstore.herokuapp.com/pet)

## Prerequisites

Having NodeJs (v6.9+, with NPM), Java (v1.8) and Maven (v3.3+) installed.

## Installation

### Front-end

In order to download all dependencies to build the front-end, run `npm install` in the `src/man/angular` folder.

### Back-end

In order to download all dependencies to build the back-end, run `mvn install` in the `src/man/java` folder.

## Build the application

Execute the following commands in order to build properly the application:

1. `node_modules/.bin/ng` (or `node_modules/.bin/ng.cmd` for windows) in the `src/man/angular` folder;
2. `mvn install` in the `src/man/java` folder.

Then, a jar is produce in `src/man/java/target` folder.

## Run the application

Once the jar is generated, `java -jar petstore.jar`, with `petstore.jar` the path to the generated jar, start the server.

It is also possible to run `mvn spring-boot:run` in `src/man/java` folder to start it.

It can be accessed with the URL [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
Localhost can be replaced with any address referring to the computer launching the jar.

## Organization of the pet store

### Front-end

The front-end contains all the `HTML`, `CSS` and `Angular` components to display, fetch and send the pet data.
It consume the back-end REST API explained in the next part.

* `http://localhost:8080/pet` let you access the list of all pets;
* `http://localhost:8080/pet/1` with `1` an ID, let you access the detail of a pet;
* `http://localhost:8080/pet/1/edit`  with `1` an ID, let you edit the detail of a pet;
* `http://localhost:8080/pet/create` let you create a pet.

#### List of pets

This list behaviour can be found at `src/main/angular/src/app/pet/list` folder.
It contain a component managing the list of pets. The subfolder `pet` manage a pet of this list.

#### Pet's detail

The detail of a pet behaviour can be found at `src/main/angular/src/app/pet/pet-detail` folder.

#### Pet's creation

The creation of a pet behaviour can be found at `src/main/angular/src/app/pet/pet-create` folder.

#### Edit a pet

The edition of a pet behaviour can be found at `src/main/angular/src/app/pet/pet-edit` folder.

#### Pet service

The pet service can be found at `src\main\angular\src\app\services\pet\pet.service.ts` and regroup the http calls to the back-end.
It also contain the handling of any http error returned by the server defined in `http-errors.service.ts`.

### Back-end

#### Controllers

The controllers can be found at `src/main/java/src/main/java/com/petstore/controllers`.

The `PetController` class maps the REST URL to the java pet service.

The `ApplicationController` allow the front-end part to change the url to any /pet URL and subURL
and still redirect to the index.html page, allowing browser refresh.

#### Services

The services can be found at `src/main/java/src/main/java/com/petstore/services`.

It contain the `CrudService` interface containing all basic CRUD operations.

The `PetService` interface extends the `CrudService` for the `Pet` entity.

The `PetServiceImpl` class contain the implementations of the `PetService`.
It is created to call the right repository.

#### Repositories

The repositories can be found at `src/main/java/src/main/java/com/petstore/repositories`.

It contain the `PetRepository`. It extends `CrudRepository` in order to access the database and perform the CRUD operations.

#### Model

The model can be found at `src/main/java/src/main/java/com/petstore/model`.

It contain the Pet entity stored into the database.
